### [_High-Dimensional Probability_: Answers, Theorems, and Definitions](hdp.pdf)
- My answers to exercises (with required theorems lifted) from [_High-Dimensional Probability_](https://www.math.uci.edu/~rvershyn/papers/HDP-book/HDP-book.html), by Roman Vershynin.
- I wrote these to aid my personal study of the book. Read them at your own risk!
